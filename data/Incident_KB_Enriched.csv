discrepancies in CBS System",P1,Client,"1. Analysis of the Production Log Files: 
Objective: Analyze the log files related to the reported issue. 
Findings:  
 The investigation revealed that transactions were 
successfully sent to the Equitas CBS system. 
 However, data was not stored correctly in the 
ENCollect CBS table post 10:15 PM when the 
maximum concurrency setting was increased to handle 
high load data more efficiently. 
2. Analysis of the Reconciliation Query: 
Objective: Analyze the reconcile query. 
Findings:  
 The investigation revealed that the reconciliation query 
produced false data due to partial data storage in the 
ENCollect CBS table after 10:15 PM. 
 This partial data storage was unknown to the Equitas 
Bank Production Support team, leading them to 
reinitiate the transactions to push them to the Equitas 
Bank CBS system again, causing duplicates. 
3. Analysis of the Code for Partial Data Storage: 
Objective: Investigate whether increased concurrency 
settings impacted data storage. 
. 
Findings:  
 At high concurrency, database transactions were not 
completing within the expected timeframe, leading to 
partial commits. 
 This resulted in a mismatch when the reconciliation 
query was executed. 
 Code improvements have been identified to ensure all 
transactions commit fully before being considered for 
reconciliation.",".Removal of Duplicate Transactions in Equitas CBS

when the maximum concurrency value is increased.

 Verification Status: Verified by Equitas Bank 
2. Code Optimization for High Concurrency

an increased max concurrency value to avoid partial data 
storage in the ENCollect CBS table.

intermediate tables. This slowness led end users to believe that the

1. Existence of the Issue in UAT: 
Objective: Verify if the issue is present in the UAT 
environment. 
Findings: The issue was confirmed to be absent in the UAT 
environment, indicating that the problem was isolated to the 
production environment. 
2. Analysis of the Issue in Production: 
Objective: Identify the cause of the failure in the production 
environment. 
Findings:  
1. A significant accumulation of data was observed in the 
allocations intermediate tables. 
2. Duplicate records were causing errors in the SSIS 
package, preventing it from reaching the truncate 
command for clearing the intermediate tables. 
3. Since resolving this issue required extensive changes 
across SSIS packages and considering that the 
upcoming DBS ENCollect upgrade (to be delivered to 
DBS) already addresses this issue, a temporary 
housekeeping cleanup job was implemented. ","Truncated Allocations Intermediate Tables:
