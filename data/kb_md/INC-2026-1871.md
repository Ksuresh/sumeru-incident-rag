## Summary
Service unreachable due to DNS misconfiguration / load balancer target group drift. Observed after v3.2.4 in EU.

## Impact Scope
Users unable to access the application; 502/504 at edge. Metric: 5xx spike 22%.

## Observability / Logs
ELB 504 Gateway Timeout spike

## Root Cause (as recorded)
DNS record change not propagated / LB target group missing new nodes after deploy.

## Resolution Steps
Reverted DNS; refreshed LB targets; validated health checks; cleared caches.

## Detection & Resolution Timing
- Time to Detect (TTD): 59m
- Time to Resolve (TTR): 8m

## Preventive Actions
Change freeze guardrails; DNS validation pipeline; automated LB target reconciliation.

## Automation Suggestion
NetRouteAgent to validate DNS/LB changes pre-merge; auto-run synthetic checks.
