## Summary
Service unreachable due to DNS misconfiguration / load balancer target group drift. Observed after v3.2.1 in US.

## Impact Scope

## Observability / Logs
NXDOMAIN for api.company.com

## Root Cause (as recorded)
DNS record change not propagated / LB target group missing new nodes after deploy.

- Time to Resolve (TTR): 2h 6m

## Preventive Actions
