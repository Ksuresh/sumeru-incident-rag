# Incident INC-2025-0439

## Summary
Upstream dependency degraded causing increased failures and retries. Observed after v3.3.2 in US.

## Impact Scope
Partial failures; slow transactions; increased error rates. Metric: memory 95%.

## Observability / Logs
HTTP 429/503 from upstream; retry storm detected

## Root Cause (as recorded)
Vendor incident / rate limiting; our retry policy too aggressive.

## Resolution Steps
Enabled circuit breaker; reduced retry; used fallback; contacted vendor support.

## Detection & Resolution Timing
- Time to Detect (TTD): 1 Hr
- Time to Resolve (TTR): 2 Hr

## Preventive Actions
Tune retries; add vendor SLO monitoring; implement bulkhead isolation.

## Automation Suggestion
DependencyWatch agent to detect upstream degradation and auto-adjust retries.
