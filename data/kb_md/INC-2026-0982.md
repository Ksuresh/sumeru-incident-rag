# Incident INC-2026-0982

## Summary
Upstream dependency degraded causing increased failures and retries. Observed after v4.0.0 in EU.

## Impact Scope
Partial failures; slow transactions; increased error rates. Metric: 5xx spike 22%.

## Observability / Logs
Upstream timeout calling vendor API after 10s

## Root Cause (as recorded)
Vendor incident / rate limiting; our retry policy too aggressive.

## Resolution Steps
Enabled circuit breaker; reduced retry; used fallback; contacted vendor support.

## Detection & Resolution Timing
- Time to Detect (TTD): 43m
- Time to Resolve (TTR): 3 Hr

## Preventive Actions
Tune retries; add vendor SLO monitoring; implement bulkhead isolation.

## Automation Suggestion
DependencyWatch agent to detect upstream degradation and auto-adjust retries.
